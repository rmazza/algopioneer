# algopioneer

Lightweight README for the `algopioneer` Rust crate.

## Overview

This crate is part of the algopioneer project. It contains the core application and related logic for algorithmic trading research and experiments.

(If you expected a different folder, tell me and I can move or create a README elsewhere.)

## Prerequisites

- Rust (stable) and Cargo installed: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- Optional but useful: `cargo-edit` (for `cargo add`) â€” install with `cargo install cargo-edit`.

## Adding dependencies

I previously attempted to run:

cargo add cbadv-rs polars ta-rs tokio --features "tokio/full polars/lazy" dotenv

Note: that command failed because crates.io did not contain a crate named `cbadv-rs`. If `cbadv-rs` is a private crate, provide a git URL or a local path and it can be added with `cargo add --git <url> cbadv-rs` or by editing `Cargo.toml`.

To add the other dependencies (polars, ta-rs, tokio, dotenv) you can run:

cargo add polars ta-rs tokio --features "tokio/full polars/lazy" dotenv

(Adjust features or crate names as needed.)

## Build & run

From the crate root (`/home/bob/dev/algopioneer`):

cargo build --release
cargo run --release

## Tests

Run unit/integration tests with:

cargo test

## Notes

- If you want me to re-run the `cargo add` command after you provide a correct crate name or source for `cbadv-rs`, say so and I'll run it.
- If you'd like a README at the workspace root or for the other crate (`algo-pioneer`), tell me and I'll create one there.
