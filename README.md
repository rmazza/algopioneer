AlgoPioneer is a lightweight Rust toolkit for algorithmic trading research and experiments. The project provides a small wrapper around the Coinbase Advanced Trade API (via the `cbadv` crate), a Polars-based data pipeline, and a sample Moving Average Crossover strategy with unit tests.

This README describes how to build, run, and test the current implementation.

Features
- Coinbase Advanced Trade API client (authentication wired from environment)
- Polars for fast in-memory data handling and rolling-window computations
- A Moving Average Crossover strategy with unit tests demonstrating signal generation
- Local development convenience: `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, and test harness

Prerequisites
- Rust (stable) and Cargo: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- Optional tools: `cargo-edit` (`cargo install cargo-edit`), `gh` (GitHub CLI) if you use repository automation

Environment variables
This project reads credentials from a local `.env` file (loaded with `dotenv`). Do NOT commit your real `.env` file. Instead create a local copy from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill in your Coinbase credentials in .env
```

The following variables are used by the code:
- COINBASE_API_KEY — Advanced Trade API key identifier
- COINBASE_API_SECRET — Advanced Trade API secret (private key)
- (Optional) COINBASE_USE_SANDBOX — set to `true` to use sandbox endpoints if supported

Project layout (important files)
- `src/main.rs` — binary entrypoint (initializes client, runs a connectivity test)
- `src/coinbase/mod.rs` — Coinbase client wrapper that wires credentials into `cbadv::RestClientBuilder`
- `src/strategy/moving_average.rs` — Moving Average Crossover strategy and unit tests
- `Cargo.toml` — dependencies (Polars, cbadv, tokio, dotenv, etc.)
- `.env.example` — template for required environment variables (safe to commit)

Build & run
From the project root:

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

`cargo run` executes the binary which performs a basic connectivity test (server time) and prints the result. Authenticated endpoints (account info, balances) require valid API credentials and the proper permissions on your API key.

Tests

Run the unit tests with:

```bash
cargo test
```

The repository includes a unit-tested moving-average strategy. Tests should pass with the current codebase.

Development notes
- Rolling-window computations are implemented using Polars' native `rolling_mean` (requires the `rolling_window` feature).
- Keep secrets out of the repo: use `.env` locally and CI secret stores for automated runs.
- If you add large data files or outputs, ignore them via `.gitignore` (the repo already ignores `/target`).

Contributing
- Fork or branch and open a PR. Add unit tests for new behavior. CI (GitHub Actions) can be added to run `cargo test` on PRs — I can scaffold that for you.

License
- MIT — see the `LICENSE` file.

Questions / Next steps
- Want a CI workflow to run tests on push/PR? I can add a basic GitHub Actions YAML that runs `cargo test`.
- Want example authenticated read-only calls (list accounts) added to `src/coinbase/mod.rs`? I can add and run them locally (they will hit your live API keys).

---
Updated to match the current implementation.

From the crate root (`/home/bob/dev/algopioneer`):

cargo build --release
cargo run --release

## Tests

Run unit/integration tests with:

cargo test

## Notes

- If you want me to re-run the `cargo add` command after you provide a correct crate name or source for `cbadv-rs`, say so and I'll run it.
- If you'd like a README at the workspace root or for the other crate (`algo-pioneer`), tell me and I'll create one there.

Generated by an automated assistant to bootstrap documentation and track the missing dependency `cbadv-rs`.
