1.  **Analyze the Project Structure**:
    *   List all files in `src/` and subdirectories to identify new modules or strategies.
    *   Read `Cargo.toml` to identify key dependencies.
    *   Read `src/main.rs` to identify available CLI commands and arguments.

2.  **Read Current Documentation**:
    *   Read the current `README.md`.
    *   Read `GEMINI.md` (if it exists) for high-level project context.

3.  **Update README.md**:
    *   Update the "Features" section to include any new strategies found in `src/strategy/`.
    *   Update the "Usage" section to include examples for any new CLI commands found.
    *   Update the "Project Structure" section to reflect the current file layout.
    *   Ensure the "Prerequisites" and "Setup" sections are accurate based on `Cargo.toml` and project requirements.
    *   Maintain the existing style and formatting of the `README.md`.

4.  **Verify**:
    *   Ensure the updated `README.md` is accurate and helpful for a new user.
