1. Read `Cargo.toml` to identify the project name, version, and dependencies.
2. List all files in `src/` and its subdirectories to understand the project structure.
3. Read `src/main.rs` to understand the application entry point and high-level logic.
4. Read `GEMINI.md` to see the current documentation.
5. Analyze the gathered information to identify:
    - New dependencies or removed ones.
    - New modules or strategies (e.g., in `src/strategy/`).
    - Changes in architecture or build instructions.
6. Update `GEMINI.md` with the new information, ensuring the "Project Overview", "Key Technologies", "Architecture", and "Development Conventions" sections are accurate.
